# R Script to Extract US Census Data by Zip Code

## Introduction 
This R script helps extract the population percentage estimates (for example, by race/ethnicity or language use) from the American Community Survey (ACS) and US Census for relevant zip codes. This script also includes a way to calculate an entropy value that represents the diversity of different racial/ethnic/language groups in that particular zip code (i.e., a way to weigh the number and amount of different racial/ethnic/language groups in a zip code) using the R package 'philentropy.'

Before using this script, download the relevant American Community Surveys from the US census download center: https://data.census.gov/cedsci/

## Race & Ethnicity
1) Go to https://data.census.gov/cedsci/
2) Search "DP05" 
3) click "ACS DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING ESTIMATES"
4) click "Customize Table"
5) click "Geographies"
6) select "Zip Code Tabulation Area (Five-Digit)"
7) select "Within Other Geographies" below it "Zip Code Tabulation Area (Five-Digit)"
8) select "All ZCTAs in United States"
9) Then click "download" and select 2019 (or the latest year you want)

The file name of the dataset should be like this (except with an updated download date) : ACSDP5Y2019.DP05_data_with_overlays_2021-05-12T022242.csv

Below is a screenshot of how to access and download the correct dataset file for 2018 dataset:

## Population density
This one is taken from the 2010 US census instead of ACS because ACS does not have population density measures (or as far as I can find).
Instead of download center, go to advanced search and search the following term:
"Population, Housing Units, Area, and Density: 2010 - State -- 5-digit ZIP Code Tabulation Area  more information - 2010 Census Summary File 1""

The file name of the dataset should be : DEC_10_SF1_GCTPH1.ST09_with_ann.csv

### Description of columns of interests 
 - GCT_STUB.display-label (7th column) : Target zipcode
 - HD01 : population
 - SUBHD0303 : AREA CHARACTERISTICS - Area (Land)
 - SUBHD0401 : Density per square mile of land area - Population
